#### Brief Description of Project - 

We are developing a Garment Factory Management System for Lakshika Fashion Garments PVT LTD,
Yakkala. The garment factory which we selected is a mid-size enterprise and they are expecting to expand
their business. Their business module is buying raw clothing material from suppliers, sewing pants and jeans
(trousers, shorts for both ladies and gents) and selling the final product to the customers (Kandy Fashion
Store, Thilakawardana Textile, Sarasavi Textile, Geeza Fashion, etc ). Currently they have ledgers which are
updated manually for each department run by managers (managers of employees, manager of
Transportations, managers of business affairs). Details regarding customers, suppliers, employees,
expenditures, employee attendance, Assets are also stored manually. They have over 50 employees who are
managed by 6 managers.
With the automated system we are expecting to introduce, the main features of the garment factory will be
divided into Customer (Fashion Center) Management, Supplier Management, HR Management, Transport
Management, Finance Management, Work Management, Resource Management and Design Management.
First customers need to send a request to the admin to get approved for a customer type account. Then the
customer orders a certain amount of clothing from the garment factory through the web application. The
admin views the order and then send a request to the supplier to confirm if they have enough fabrics
to complete the order. If the supplier give confirmation, the admin accepts the order. When the supplier sends
the material, production of the order begins, which is divided among employees by the managers through the
web application. When the order is finalized, it is then sent to the transportation department to be sent to the
customer. The financial side of the business is also handled by the system. Currently the reports created by
managers have a chance of not being fully accurate, storing data and calculations can be time consuming,
having to store data in physical locations make the data vulnerable, payments are received as cash or cheques
which are not Recommended.
All these problems were risen because everything within the business is handled manually.
By upgrading to an automated system reports can be generated automatically and also instantly with full
accuracy, Storing data is less time consuming than the manual system, the human labor that was being used
for the manual system can Now be used for something else, data stored within the system is safer and it only
takes a very small space to store to details, financial Side can now be handled by the system rather than the
outdated cash or cheques method.
